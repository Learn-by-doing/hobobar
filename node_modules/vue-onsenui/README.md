With Onsen UI you can create beautiful and performant hybrid apps that run on both Android and iOS. This package contains [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) v2 bindings and components that makes it easy to integrate the Onsen UI components in Vue apps.

For more information of what's included in Onsen UI please see:

* [Main repo](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI)
* [Official website](https://onsen.io/)

## Status

`vue-onsenui` bindings are currently in **alpha status**. This means that the API of the components could change from the current version to the final release. We want the bindings to feel like a Vue extension. Therefore, we are open to suggestions about the API.

Also, bugs and things to improve surely exist in this version, so please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues).

## Installation

#### Package Manager (yarn, npm)

```
yarn add onsenui vue-onsenui --save
```

#### Direct download

Get `onsenui.js`, `onsenui.css` and `onsenui-css-components.css` from the [latest core release](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/releases). You will also need `vue-onsenui.js` file from [this CDN link](https://unpkg.com/vue-onsenui).

## Including Vue.js and Onsen UI

#### ES6 imports and Webpack (with CSS imports)

```javascript
import 'onsenui/css/onsenui.css';
import 'onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.css';

import Vue from 'vue';
import 'onsenui';
import VueOnsen from 'vue-onsenui';

Vue.use(VueOnsen);
```

#### Direct include in index.html

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="onsen-css-components.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="onsenui.css">

<script src="vue.js"></script>
<script src="onsenui.js"></script>
<script src="vue-onsenui.js"></script>

<!-- Vue.use(VueOnsen) is called automatically if window.Vue is defined -->
```

## Examples - Running the development server

The examples are located under `/bindings/vue/examples` directory in the main repo.

You can serve these examples by running the development server. First you need to [build the main repo](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI#how-to-manually-build-this-project). When that is done you can run the following commands from `/bindings/vue/` directory:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

This will open a development server with a kitchen sink app in `localhost:8080`.

## Support

If you need help using these bindings we recommend you to use [our forum](https://community.onsen.io/) to ask questions. We also have a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/OnsenUI/OnsenUI).

If you find any bug or want to request features/ API changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues). Make sure to include all information necessary to reproduce it if you file a bug report.
